## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Explicitly bypass Jekyll
The VitePress documentation build MUST generate a `.nojekyll` file at the root of the output `dist` folder to prevent GitHub Pages from processing the site as a Jekyll project.

#### Scenario: Building the site with VitePress
- **WHEN** the user runs the `npm run docs:build` command
- **THEN** an empty `.nojekyll` file is present in the `docs/.vitepress/dist` folder

### Requirement: Configure GitHub Pages Source
The repository's GitHub Pages settings MUST be configured to deploy via GitHub Actions rather than deploying from a specific branch like `main/docs`.

#### Scenario: Navigating to the deployed GitHub Pages site
- **WHEN** the GitHub Actions deployment workflow successfully completes and the user visits the GitHub Pages URL
- **THEN** the VitePress-generated UI is served correctly with full CSS styling and JS functionality, not the legacy unstyled Jekyll fallback
